# SP-500-Time-Series-analysis

In this statistical project we study the properties of the financial series of the SP500 index since 1980. We perform a statistical analysis of the properties of the series:

* Descriptive statistics
* Stationarity
* Normality
* Autocorrelation
* Financial interpretation of properties

We explore different modeling approaches:

* Exponential smoothing and moving average smoothing
* ARIMA model
* ARCH and GARCH volatility model
* Combination of ARIMA and ARCH models
